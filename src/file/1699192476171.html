<undefined>Dry eye is a condition that occurs when tears cannot properly lubricate the eyes. This is caused by either a decrease in tear creation or an increase in tear evaporation. If not treated, dry eye can cause lasting damage to the corneal surface and declining vision.</undefined>
<undefined>Esen Akpek, M.D., director of the Ocular Surface Disease and Dry Eye Clinic at the Wilmer Eye Institute discusses the causes, symptoms and treatment options for this common condition.</undefined>
<undefined>What causes dry eye?</undefined>
<undefined>Several factors can cause dry eye.</undefined>
<undefined>Evaporation of water from the tear film can increase due to blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction. “Blepharitis/meibomian gland dysfunction causes decreased production or altered composition of oil and is a common condition associated with rosacea, Demodex mites, graft versus host disease and other conditions,” says Akpek.</undefined>

<undefined>Decreased tear production is often associated with an autoimmune or inflammatory systemic condition such as Sjögren’s, sarcoidosis, lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, which can damage the tear glands. “Pain sensation, such as dryness or discomfort, is part of the creation of tears, so eyes with decreased sensation will tear less,” says Akpek. “In addition, since normal pain sensation is necessary for corneal surface cell regeneration, the loss of that sensation is detrimental to the health of the cornea.”</undefined>
<undefined>Decreased corneal sensation can be caused by:</undefined>
<undefined>Sjögren’s is one of the most common causes of tear gland damage. This is a chronic inflammatory disease in which mucous membranes, especially those in the eyes and the mouth, become extremely dry. Patients with Sjogren’s syndrome are at risk for developing internal organ involvement such as hepatitis, interstitial lung disease, nephritis, vasculitis or lymphoma.</undefined>

<undefined>Dry eye syndrome can be diagnosed by the following methods.</undefined>
<undefined>Dry Eye Treatment</undefined>
<undefined>Treatment for dry eye syndrome depends largely on the severity of the disease.</undefined>
<undefined>Mild cases of dry eye syndrome require no more than use of artificial tear solutions and hot compresses, with eyelid massage using ophthalmic ointments.</undefined>
<undefined>“If the condition is not sufficiently managed with artificial tears, you might use sustained-release eye lubricants,” says Akpek. An insert placed in the eye area slowly dissolves and thickens the tear film, Akpek explains. “Your doctor might also recommend prescription eyedrops,” she says.</undefined>
<undefined>You may also opt for scleral lenses, which are special contact lenses that trap moisture onto the eye’s surface.</undefined>
